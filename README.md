<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  To-do-list is a simple web app that was created as a team project for *CodersCamp 2019*.
  The project's aim was to learn the basics of node.js and make apps for each backend and frontend and to enable communication between them.


### Built With
The website was created with:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

A REST API was made with Express.js in Node.js.
Finally we deployed both apps using [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and *mongoDB* database in the cloud.
